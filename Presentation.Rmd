# Background: Lack of User-Centered Design

The electronic format is not fully optimized for clinicians' workflow and has introduced several barriers:

- Difficulty searching for patient data (McDonald et al., 2014)

- Poor readability & redundancy (Farri et al., 2012)

- Reduced efficiency (Young et al., 2018)

- Increased clerical burden & increased risk of physician burnout (Shanafelt et al., 2016)

<br />

<font color=#fcc30f>"The real art of medical diagnosis comes in seeing the connections between problems—something that was well-documented on paper, perhaps because we weren’t so exhausted from all the thunderous clicks that we still had the time and energy to actually think about the case and the context."</font> 

--Dr. Robert Wachter (2012)


???

- 2. Nearly 41% of internists reported that finding and reviewing medical record data took more overall time
to perform using the electronic medical record (EMR) than before the use of electronic formats
(McDonald et al., 2014). 

- 4. In one study, it was found that primary care physicians (PCPs) spend
more than one-half of their work day, nearly six hours, interacting with the EHR (Arndt et al.,
2017).

- Researchers also found the number of mouse clicks within the EMR commonly exceeds 400 times per hour for every 2.5 patients seen by the physician (Hill et al., 2013). Over the course of a day, a physician could easily register over 4,000 mouse clicks in an attempt to access or enter information for a patient visit.

# Background: Communication & Sharing

# Purpose of Study

Using chronic pain patient notes within the electronic medical record (EMR), the objectives of this study were to:

<font color=#fcc30f>1.</font> Evaluate word embeddings to determine an appropriate model that captures semantic (i.e., meaning) and syntactic (i.e., language) content of the patient note for downstream applications.  

<br />

<font color=#fcc30f>2.</font> Examine the current subject matter and structure of patient notes to discover the level of personalized information important to patient care. 

<br />

<font color=#fcc30f>3.</font> Identify ways that physicians could be incorporated into the process of artificial intelligence for health care.

# Methods: Word Embeddings

<font color=#fcc30f>
You shall know a word by the company it keeps... (Firth, 1957)
</font>

<br />
- At its core, a word embedding transforms words into numbers

- First step (layer) in deep neural networks for downstream applications

- Word embeddings are commonly divided between 
    1. Co-occurrence models
    
    2. Prediction models
    
---

# Methods: Word Embeddings

1. Co-occurrence models
    - Based on words frequently appearing together
    
    - Global Vectors <font color=#fcc30f>(GloVe)</font>
    
2. Prediction models
    - Predict context (i.e., surrounding) word or target word

    - <font color=#fcc30f>Word2vec</font> - word n-grams
    
    - <font color=#fcc30f>fastText</font> - character n-grams + word n-grams

---

<!-- # Methods: Word Embeddings -->

<!-- Many parameters to consider for each of the models: -->

<!-- - Dimension size (e.g., 50, 300, 1000) -->

<!-- - Window size (e.g., 5, 8, 10) -->

<!-- - Negative sampling (e.g., 5, 10) -->

<!-- - Epochs (e.g., 10, 25, 50) -->

<!-- - Skip-gram vs Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) -->

<!-- - Minimum word counts (e.g., 2, 5, 50) -->

<!-- ??? -->

<!-- - Dimension: how many numbers represent a word -->
<!-- - Window size: how many words to consider to the left and right of a target word -->
<!-- - Negative sampling: modifies just a small percentage of the weights instead of for all words -->
<!-- - Epochs: iterations -->

<!-- In the "skip-gram" mode alternative to "CBOW", rather than averaging the context words, each is used as a pairwise training example. That is, in place of one CBOW example such as [predict 'ate' from average('The', 'cat', 'the', 'mouse')], the network is presented with four skip-gram examples [predict 'ate' from 'The'], [predict 'ate' from 'cat'], [predict 'ate' from 'the'], [predict 'ate' from 'mouse']. (The same random window-reduction occurs, so half the time that would just be two examples, of the nearest words.) -->

# Methods: Word Embeddings

???

Based on a priori testing, the following parameters were chosen for each of the three models.

- Dimension: how many numbers represent a word
- Window size: how many words to consider to the left and right of a target word
- Negative sampling: modifies just a small percentage of the weights instead of for all words
- Epochs: iterations

- Each model took between 20 minutes and 14 hours to run with over 30 models created. 
- The models with the parameters above were retained for intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation.

# Methods: Intrinsic Evaluation

<font color=#fcc30f>Semantic relatedness and similarity of words:</font>

1. Word similarity & analogies (cosine similarity)
    - king:queen::man:woman
    
    - perfect: perfection, perfectly, ideal, flawless, good, always
    
2. Word clustering
    - t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) + principal components analysis (PCA)
            
    - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) with Louvain community detection

3. Expert/Physician Review
    - Interactive dashboard
    
???

2. Word clustering (similar words in close proximity grouped together)
    - t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) + principal components analysis (PCA)
        - Collapses many dimensions (200) down to 2
        
    - k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with Louvain community detection (similar to network analysis)
        - Groups similar words

Interactive dashboard that includes both 1) and 2)

# Methods: Extrinsic Evaluation

Extrinsic methods assess the impact of the system on specific task performance
based on measures such as success rate, time-to-completion, and decision-making accuracy (Wang et al., 2018).

<br />

- No good domain-specific (chronic pain), health care ontologies exist for evaluation 

- Possible downstream application aim to simplify the patient note

<br />

<font color=#fcc30f>Predict text readability (grade level) of the patient note utilizing the word embeddings.</font>
    
---

# Methods: Extrinsic Evaluation
    
- Three readability formulas:
    1. <font color=#fcc30f>Flesch-Kincaid Grade:</font> Average number of words per sentence, number of syllables per word
    
    2. <font color=#fcc30f>Gunning Fog Index:</font> Average number of words per sentence, percentage of words with more than two syllables
    
    3. <font color=#fcc30f>SMOG Readability Formula:</font> Number of words with more than two syllables
    
- Convolution neural network (CNN)
    - Several configurations of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, dropout) were tested for optimization
    
    - Training: 70%; Validation: 30%; 
    
    - 150 epochs (i.e., iterations)

# Conclusions: Choosing a Model

<br />

- Word similarity better captured by smaller dimensional models [7]

    - More separation between dissimilar words and clusters

<br />

- Larger dimensional models more effective for complex, downstream tasks, i.e., prediction/classification

    - Word2vec & GloVe (200 dimensions) with highest predictive accuracy

<br />

- No one-size-fits-all model?
    
???

- No one-size-fits-all model?
    - Misspellings, diverse range of content --> dependent upon downstream tasks

---

# Conclusions: Choosing a Model

<br />

- Word2vec 200 appears most robust

<br />

- fastText 200 delivers useful tools (e.g., spellchecker)

<br />

- GloVe 200 seemed to capture some personal level details

<br /> 

- Expert consensus: Word2vec

# Conclusions & Future Directions

<br />

- Missing the <font color=#fcc30f>"A"</font> in the SOAP note
    - Physicians use templates and miss the narrative/story within the patient note
    
    - Large amount of phrase/sentence collocation
